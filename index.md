# Welcome to the Isobel Parkin's Lab!

We are part of the [Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Saskatoon Research and development center (AAFC)](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/scientific-collaboration-and-research-in-agriculture/agriculture-and-agri-food-research-centres-and-collections/saskatchewan/saskatoon-research-and-development-centre/scientific-staff-and-expertise/parkin-isobel-phd/?id=1181853634490). I have been a Research Scientist with AAFC since 1999 and an adjunct Professor at the University of Saskatchewan since 2004. 

Research in our laboratory is focused on genomics, bioinformatics and molecular biology of Brassica and related organisms. Our goal is to apply various genomics tools to improve the crop perfromace and understand basic mechanisims and evolution.Together with Prof. [Andrew Sharpe](https://p2irc.usask.ca/profiles/theme-1/andrew-sharpe.php), I co-led the Canadian Canola Genome Sequencing (CanSeq) industry consortium project that developed a high quality genome sequence as part of the multinational Brassica Genome Sequencing initiative.

Areas of Interest:
Brassica genomics, comparative genome organisation, global variantion and gene expression analysis, abiotic stress responses, genome evolution

Current research funding sources include the [Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS)](https://www.gifs.ca/), Saskatchewan Agriculture Development Fund, AAFC Crop Genomics Initiative, and canola producer groups.
