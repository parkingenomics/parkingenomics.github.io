Research in our laboratory is focused on genomics, bioinformatics and molecular biology of Brassica and related organisms. Our goal is to apply various genomics tools to improve the crop perfromace and better understand basic mechanisims and evolution

Areas of Interst:
Brassica genomics, comparative genome organisation, global variantion and gene expression analysis, abiotic stress responses, genome evolution
