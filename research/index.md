## Current Projects:
Genomics, genetics and bioinformatics platforms <br>
Functional genomics of stress resistance in plants






## Research in the Zunder lab is focused on discovering the mechanisms that control stem cell fate.


### Our research takes advantage of the close parallels between *in vitro* stem cell differentiation and *in vivo* development. Our *in vitro* experiments can provide insight into stem cell behavior during normal development and disease, and our *in vivo* experiments can provide insight into the derivation of clinically relevant cell types for regenerative therapy.
